In SCRUM, there are four meetings:

1. *Sprint Planning* - Laying out the work to be performed for the sprint. (4 to 8 hours)
1. *Daily Scrum* - Inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal. (15 mins)
1. *Sprint Review* - Inspect the outcome of the Sprint. (1 to 4 hours)
1. *Sprint Retrospective* - Plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness. (1 to 3 hours)
